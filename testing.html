      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke">
        A joke is a short humorous piece of oral literature in which the funniness culminates in the final sentence, called the punchline… In fact, the main condition is that the tension should reach its highest level at the very end. No continuation relieving the tension should be added. As for its being "oral," it is true that jokes may appear printed, but when further transferred, there is no obligation to reproduce the text verbatim, as in the case of poetry. —Robert Hetzron

      <p>According to the British Museum, the first recorded joke dates to around 2600 BCE. Authored on the Westcar Papyrus by Pharaoh Snefru's court magician, Djadjamankh, it reads: "How do you entertain a bored pharaoh? You sail a boatload of young women dressed only in fishing nets down the Nile and urge the pharaoh to go catch a fish."</p>
