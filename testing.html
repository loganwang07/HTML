          <h2 class="header">The History of Jokes</h2>
          <p>2600 BC – King Snefru of Egypt's court magician Djadjamankh gives him a papyrus reading, "How do you entertain a bored pharaoh? You sail a boatload of young women dressed only in fishing nets down the Nile and urge the pharaoh to go catch a fish." According to researchers at the British Museum, this is the first written joke.</p>
          <p>350 BC – The original Friar’s Club – the "Group of Sixty" – meet regularly in the Temple of Heracles in Athens to tell jokes. Alas, none have been passed down.</p>
          <p>4th or 5th Century BC – A Greek anthology of more than 200 jokes called The Philolegos is written. The Greeks loved jokes about "scholastikos," or eggheads. An example: "An egghead was on a sea voyage when a big storm blew up, causing his slaves to weep in terror. 'Don’t cry,' he consoled them, 'I have freed you all in my will.'"</p>
          <p>1451 – Papal secretary Poggio Bracciolini collects 273 Latin jokes (and puns) in "Liber Facetiarum." Included: "A friar preaches against adultery says, 'It is such an abominable sin that I would rather sleep with ten virgins than a single married woman.' Replies Poggio: 'Many who heard him felt the same way.'"</p>
          <p>1603 – Shakespeare introduces the knock-knock joke in his play Macbeth. "Knock, knock, knock! / Who’s there, in the name of Beelzebub? / Here’s a farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty/Come in time, have napkins enough about you; here you’ll sweat for 't." Orange you glad they got better?</p>
          <p>1739 – "Joe Miller’s Jests," an English anthology of jokes, is a hit. Included: "A famous teacher of Arithmetick, who had long been married without being able to get his wife with child: One said to her, 'Madam, your husband is an excellent Arithmetician.' 'Yes,' replies she, 'only he can’t multiply.'"</p>
          <p>1845 – Edward Lear's "Book of Nonsense" popularizes the limerick: "There was a Young Lady whose chin/Resembled the point of a pin/So she had it made sharp/And purchased a harp/And played several tunes with her chin." Ladies from Nantucket would arrive later.</p>
          <p>1847 – Monthly New York magazine Knickerbocker publishes the classic, "why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side."</p>
          <p>1900 – The Polish joke arrives in America. It is believed that the jokes evolved from Jewish Poles, who had a tradition of telling "egghead" jokes about the rabbis of the city Chelm. As immigrants poured into America, these evolved to be about the Polish people in general. "How do you get a one-armed Polak out of a tree? Wave."</p>
          <p>1930s – The famed comedian Henny Youngman, trying to get an usher to escort wife Sadie to her seat, says his most famous one-liner: "take my wife – please!"</p>
          <p>1968 – Gershon Legman writes "Rationale of the Dirty Joke" chronicling blue humor, the second edition of which includes the first known version of <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/hilarious-aristocrats-gets-joke-wbna8702838" target="_blank">The Aristocrats</a> joke.</p>
          <p>2002 – An English professor hosts a contest for the world’s funniest joke. The winner, credited to comedian Spike Milligan, reads as follows: "Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn’t seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy whips out his phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps, 'My friend is dead! What can I do?' The operator says, 'Calm down. I can help. First, let’s make sure he’s dead.' There is a silence, then a shot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says, 'OK, now what?'"</p>

          <aside>
            <p>I once encountered a homeless man who asked me to spare a rupee. He said "If you give me a rupee, God will bless you with 10 thousand." I said to him "clearly, you need the 10 thousand more than I do. I’ll gladly take your money!" — Karunesh Talwar</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>The Set-Up</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>the premise on which the joke is told</li>
                <li>sets up the listener to anticipate something</li>
                <li>can be an unusual fact, an incident (made up or real), or an observation</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Detail</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>add your details and escalate your story</li>
                <li>should be a crisp, one-line statement</li>
                <li>details can be fluid but must be immediately relevant</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Punchline</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>reverses the expectations of the set-up OR escalates it to an extreme</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>Here is an example of a joke by Louis CK.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Set-Up:</span> You know what’s amazing to me, you can name your kid anything you want.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Detail:</span> There are NO laws (around naming a kid). There should be at least a couple of laws. None. You can literally name your kid anything. You can name your kid a name without vowels if you like — PNSNDLTN.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Punchline:</span> I’d like to name my kid a whole phrase. I’ll call him Ladies and Gentlemen. This is my son, Ladies and Gentlemen.</p>

      <section id="Puns">
        <article>
          <h2 class="header">Puns</h2>
          <blockquote>"A pun, also known as paronomasia, is a form of word play that exploits multiple meanings of a term, or of similar-sounding words, for an intended humorous or rhetorical effect." -Wikipedia</blockquote>
          <div>Puns have a long history in human writing. For example, the Roman playwright Plautus was famous for his puns and word games.</div>

          <aside>
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Fun Fact:</span> Shakespeare used over 3,000 puns in his plays. Surprisingly, Elizabethan literature considered puns and wordplay to be a "sign of literary refinement" more so than humor.<p>
          </aside>

          <ul>
            <li>What do you call a mean crook going down stairs? A condescending con, descending.</li>
            <li>I had a dream I was swimming in a pool of soda. Too bad it was just a Fanta sea.</li>
            <li>What did the grape say when he got stepped on? Nothing, he just let out a little wine.</li>
            <li>Why could the mathematician only work from home? Because he could only function in his domain.</li>
            <li>Did you know that I'm really good at bowling? It's right up my alley.</li>
            <li>What happens when a parsley farmer gets sued? They garnish his wages.</li>
            <li>How does Moses make his coffee? Hebrews it.</li>
            <li>How was the Roman Empire split in two? With a pair of Caesars.</li>
            <li>Did you hear about the cheese factory that caught fire? There was nothing left but de brie.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Books Never Written</h3>
          <div>Sometimes called "books never written" or "world's greatest books", these are jokes which consist of fictitious book titles with authors' names that contain a pun relating to the title. Perhaps the best-known example is: "Tragedy on the Cliff by Eileen Dover", which according to one source was devised by humourist Peter DeVries (1910-1993).</div>

          <aside>
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Fun Fact:</span> Did you know that the Tanakh (the first five books of the Bible) <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ThA8AAAAIAAJ&q=%22pun+forms+the+tie%22&pg=PA1#v=snippet&q=%22pun%20forms%20the%20tie%22&f=false" target="_blank">contains puns</a>?<p>

        <article>
          <h2 class="header">Anti-jokes</h2>
          <div>An anti-joke is a type of humor in which the joke-teller says something that is intentionally unfunny. It usually relies on the audience's expectation of something humorous, and the irony of it not being funny is what provides the comedic value.</div>

          <aside>
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Fun Fact:</span> A prank form of an anti-joke, known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xduTMrUTqI" target="_blank">no soap radio</a> was popularized in 1950s New York.<p>
          </aside>

          <p><b>The obvious punchline</b> is structured like a traditional joke, but its punchline is the most obvious to the narrative.<p>
